# DraftEditor
DraftEditor is a text editor that allows you to make amazing things with your text, it's very small and it react when you select to a text.
# I need to know how installed
You can use the normal npm:

## How was created ðŸ˜—?
Well, I'm react developer (I love it ðŸ’–) besides this projects it's just JSX and CSS.

### Why not preprocessors?
Okay... okay, preprocessor are so cool, and I know make easier the work, but I dind't need it.

## Can I improve your code or take it how example? ðŸ˜Ž
Yeah, you can!.
## How can I create a link?
I had problems with this and the only solution right now is:
<ul>
	<li>
		  Select your text
	</li>
	<li>
		  Place the mouse inside of link icon (should appear a input inside of the icon).
	</li>
	<li>
		  Write the link.
	</li>
	<li>
		  When you finish of write the link presst 'Enter'.
	</li>
</ul>
