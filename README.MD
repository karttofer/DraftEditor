## Create a Link?
I had problems with this and the only solution right now is:
<ul>
	<li>
		  Select your text
	</li>
	<li>
		  Place the mouse above of link icon (should appear a input above of the icon).
	</li>
	<li>
		  Write the link.
	</li>
	<li>
		  When you finish of write the link presst 'Enter'.
	</li>
</ul>

## How was created 😗?
Well, I'm react developer (I love it 💖) besides this projects it's just JSX and CSS.

### Why not preprocessors?
Okay... okay, preprocessor are so cool, and I know make easier the work, but I dind't need it.
